Here we've collected a list of resources on a variety of topics near and dear to our hearts (both content that has been posted on this site as well as on others).

This resource list is a work in progress. If you have any ideas for resources to add, email the [LO admin team](mailto:locally-optimistic-admins@googlegroups.com) or better yet, join the [LO community]({{< relref "community.md" >}})!
