## Joining the Community

We are thrilled you have decided to join our community. We have a growing [slack community](https://locallyoptimistic.slack.com) where current and aspiring analytics leaders discuss and share lessons and challenges from their experience working with data.

If you have not already, please [reach out](mailto:kaminsky.michael@gmail.com) to ask for an invite to our slack group. 

Once you have received your invite, please do the following:

* Read our [code of conduct]({{< relref "code_of_conduct.md" >}})
* Use your full name in your slack handle (this community will work best if we are all real humans)
* Add a profile photo
* Introduce yourself in the #general channel

In slack, remember that channels are free. If you want to start a conversation on a topic that doesn't have a channel dedicated to it, you can create a channel and invite others to join you.

## Contributing to the Blog

We are very excited to publish blog posts from current and future analytics leaders on [LocallyOptimistic](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com).

A few ground rules:

* The editorial team at LocallyOptimistic has the final word on what content gets posted. We reserve the right to reject any post for any reason at any time.
* We do not publish posts that are designed to promote a specific product or service.
* We do not compensate authors.
* We do not take compensation for publishing (no payola).

If you have an idea for a post you would like to write, reach out to someone from [the editorial team]({{< relref "about.md" >}}) on slack, and we will add you to our #authors channel where we collaborate on preparing posts for publication. 

* First, review our [licensing]({{<relref "licensing.md" >}}) policies and make sure you're okay with licensing your content under our rules.
* In order to contribute, we will need your github account so we can add you as a collaborator on [the repository](https://github.com/locallyoptimistic/LocallyOptimistic).
* To contribute, you should submit a pull request with your content and ask for a review in the #authors channel. The editorial team at LocallyOptimistic will review your post, and will likely request changes. 
* Once you have made all of the requested changes, we will determine where in the [post schedule](https://github.com/locallyoptimistic/LocallyOptimistic/wiki/Schedule) your content makes the most sense, and will set a publish date. (Note: we may re-schedule your post if we need to in order to ensure a good mix of content and authors.)

If you want to workshop post ideas, we have a channel for that in the slack group at #post-ideas. If you have other questions or concerns, please reach out on slack.
