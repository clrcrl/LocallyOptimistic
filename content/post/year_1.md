Hi Everyone! 

It is hard to believe that Locally Optimistic started [a year ago today]({{< relref "one-size-fits-none.md" >}}). In the last year we evolved from a blog (29 posts!) to a thriving [slack community](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/community/) (515 members!).

We would like to take the chance to thank each and every one of you for making this possible, including our community members, guest contributors ([Harlan]({{< relref "value-reordering-lists.md" >}}), [Ana]({{< relref "web-analytics-process.md" >}}), [Randy]({{< relref "bad_communication.md" >}}), [Michelle]({{< relref "adding_context_with_annotations.md" >}}) and [Jeremy]({{< relref "building-a-data-practice.md" >}})) and of course our amazing illustrator [Margarita](https://www.mfomenko.com/).

Here's to another great year of creating a place for current and aspiring data analytics leaders to learn and grow.

Thank you,
<br>LO Editorial Team
