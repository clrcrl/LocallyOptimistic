When I started my career, I didn’t have a career ladder, and I didn’t exactly understand the point of them. I naively assumed that if I did good work, I would be acknowledged for it. I wasn’t always sure what good work meant, but I had enough supportive colleagues around me that they usually let me know when I was heading in the wrong direction. It mostly worked - I got promoted a few times (each time a surprise to me), shifted to an entirely new field, and got promoted a few more times. Honestly, most of those promotions came as a pleasant surprise - while I love learning new things and generally tried to work on whatever was most useful to the company, I didn’t have much guidance on what the “next level” looked like.

I didn’t truly appreciate the value of a career ladder until I started to lead a team. The perspective I have now, having helped each person on my team use a career ladder to find development opportunities and work toward promotions, would have been really handy when I stumbled through the first decade of my career. To that end, this post will outline what a career ladder is, why you need one, my framework for thinking about career levels for analysts, and what I should have done 10 years ago to get more clear direction on what’s next as an individual contributor without a career ladder.

## What Is a Career Ladder?
A career ladder is a framework to document the path or paths an individual can take as they develop within their company. It describes different roles (hopefully both individual contributor roles and manager roles), outlines the expectations for each, and provides sufficiently detailed information to see what is needed to move from one role to another. A career ladder can include hard skills, as well as an outline of *how* one should work in each role and the type of impact that role should have.

## Why Clear Career Paths Matter
Analysts, of all people, want to know how they are being measured and how to reach the next level. Clearly outlining the path ahead is critical to keeping strong performers. Sometimes, it is explicitly about how to get the next promotion, but it’s also about how to increase impact, measure growth, and think about future options.

Defining a career ladder is also an opportunity for a leader to define what types of work are valuable on their team. There are hard skills you expect an analyst to get better at over time, but much more goes into being a successful contributor to the team than having deep knowledge of tools and techniques. A thoughtful career ladder is an opportunity to turn [glue work](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/glue-work/) into promotable work by clarifying expectations around collaboration, team process work, and training at various levels.

A well-crafted career ladder and development process also helps provide fair opportunity for advancement. Tools that provide objective measurements of success and eliminate ambiguity help [decrease bias](https://www.futurity.org/gender-inequality-small-wins-1636392/) in promotions and encourage managers to address work rather than personality in performance reviews. They can also help close the [gender gap](https://anitab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Climbing_the_Technical_Ladder.pdf) that exists in both expectations of what strong performance means, and self-rating against those expectations.  Both [women](https://anitab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Climbing_the_Technical_Ladder.pdf) and [under-represented minorities](https://www.exponentialtalent.com/uploads/1/6/8/4/16841408/abi-obstacles-solutions-for-underrepresented-in-tech.pdf) are more likely to consider strong career planning and coaching on the evaluation and promotion process as a highly important company practice. A commitment to defining what success looks like and coaching employees on how to get there can help attract and retain a more diverse team.

## How to Create a Career Ladder
I separate a good career ladder into two parts: guiding principles and specific competencies.

### Guiding Principles
Guiding principles are simple heuristics that capture how roles differ from each other. You don’t get promoted for just getting better at the same job, you get promoted for showing that you can do a different job.

Some examples of guiding principles:
- A general management heuristic we use at [Yerdle](https://www.yerdlerecommerce.com/about-us): a Manager executes a program with direction, while a Director can create a program from scratch with little oversight.
- Software Engineering at [Microsoft](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-SDE-SDE-II-and-Senior-SDE-at-Microsoft): a Software Engineer creates complex solutions to simple problems, a Software Engineer II creates simple solutions to simple problems, a Senior Software Engineer creates simple solutions to complex problems, and a Principal Software Engineer makes complex problems disappear.
- Design at [Lyst](https://medium.com/designing-lyst/career-progression-for-product-designers-user-researchers-at-lyst-49c0c6cb9003): Junior contributes to the work, Mid does the work, Senior leads the work, and Lead leads the team.
- Data Science, according to [Jan Zawadzki](https://towardsdatascience.com/becoming-a-level-3-0-data-scientist-52641ff73cb3): Level 1 is statistics skills, Level 2 adds engineering skills, and Level 3 adds business skills.

When I think about how analytics team members work at different levels and how to clearly articulate the difference between roles, I focus on two areas: scope of influence (how wide the impact of your work is), and what deliverables look like (the types of work you do, and what done looks like). Here is my matrix for those principles for individual contributors:
{{< figure src="/img/annotations-google-sheet.jpg" title="Guiding principles for individual contributors">}}

Guiding principles set the stage for the specific competencies that comprise the rest of the ladder. But importantly, they also enable you to create flexibility and variations of the ladder as needed. You can modify a career ladder for various flavors - for example, I’ve had members of my team who strongly wanted to follow a specialist path. I manage fairly small teams and am happy to accommodate different career paths; knowing the guiding principles allowed me to create a Product Analyst ladder and a Sales Operations Analyst ladder that spoke to their skills more specifically, but still aligned very clearly with our overall levelling strategy.

### Specific Competencies
Once you know your guiding principles, you can flesh out the skills and behaviors associated with each level. These skills and behaviors should be specific enough to guide your team’s behavior, and concrete enough to enable provide an objective measure of success. I focus on a few main types of skills, then provide several examples of how a person can demonstrate competency in each. Those categories are:
- Technical skills
- Analysis and business acumen
- Operational skills
- Mentorship and training
- Communication & interpersonal skills

Specific competencies are where it is most useful to get feedback from your team - the people who will be measured against this ladder. They can help you ensure that skills are associated with the right level, and importantly, that the ladder captures all of the types of work that they spend a significant amount of time on. This process ensures all valuable work is promotable, to minimize [glue work](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/glue-work/) on your team.

Given how significantly analytics has changed over the past few years, and how quickly we continue to adapt to a new, more engineering-oriented mindset, consider this a living document and revisit it periodically. Stay open to your team’s feedback to make sure you’re capturing the work and skills you most want to see on your team.

### The Whole Shebang
So you want to actually see a ladder, right? [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18cX6GpWOdcVKrb7Jp0iU3dy3zF6LDOtlIaKHUoZexzM/edit#gid=1231476754) is the ladder we use today at Yerdle Recommerce. We are a fairly small team (5 total), primarily individual contributor analysts. As such, my IC ladder is much more robust than my management ladder (it turns out that for myself as a manager, I’m still happy to live with ambiguity). If your team is more data science-focused than analyst-focused, there is a good ladder in [Care and Feeding of Data Scientists](https://oreilly-ds-report.s3.amazonaws.com/Care_and_Feeding_of_Data_Scientists.pdf) to get you started.

For other examples, as usual, it’s helpful to hop over to software engineering, where they’re a couple of decades ahead of us in terms of management craft. Here are some thoughtful engineering ladders that I have found helpful as I created this and prior iterations of my team’s career ladder: [Spotify](https://labs.spotify.com/2016/02/08/technical-career-path/), [Etsy](https://etsy.github.io/Etsy-Engineering-Career-Ladder/competencies.html), and [Rent the Runway](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxmQBrDZvj16veuc2OVO0wUX7a7vEKPM-57dNLXhuEk/edit). [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/senior-engineer/) also has some really great thoughts on the fundamental differences between an Engineer and a Senior Engineer.

## How to Use a Career Ladder
As a manager, the career ladder is the most valuable document I have created for my team. By providing clarity and structure around expectations, it empowers individuals to decide what skills and competencies to focus on improving. However, writing the career ladder is only the beginning - you have to communicate it to your team about, and use it as a jumping off point for specific, growth-oriented development conversations to get the most value. It’s also helpful as a tool to manage upward and actually get your team the promotions they deserve.

### Roll it Out
Once you’ve created your ladder, share it with your team. Explain why it exists and how you’ll use it. Set clear expectations on what levels mean - do employees need to have demonstrated 100% of the competencies laid out for a level before they can be promoted, or is there room for folks to specialize and exceed expectations in one area while not meeting the threshold in another? Does your company promote people they believe have the ability to achieve at the next level, or do you expect someone to have already demonstrated that level of work for 3 or 6 months before they are eligible for promotion? Is there a fixed promotion schedule or is it ad-hoc? Make sure your team understands how the ladder fits into the overall company approach to leveling and salaries, if there is one. Answer questions and make sure your team understands that this is a living document which will change over time.

### Growth Conversations
Have regular, growth-focused conversations with your team members. The cadence and content may vary, but I’ll outline what has worked for me.

- When someone joins my team, I have a general career conversation with them to understand where they want to go and how their current position can help them get there. This is the chance for them to tell me, “I don’t actually want to be a Senior Analyst, I want to be a Product Manager eventually.” If so, I do what I can to help them work on developing skills and getting involved with projects that will help them make that transition.
- For folks who do want a promotion on my team, we check in on the career ladder twice a year. The team member and I each go through the ladder separately to benchmark where we each believe they are in regards to each competency. Doing this assessment independently and then comparing helps highlight areas of misalignment, which may be due to lack of clarity in the job ladder, a lack of self-awareness from your team member, or you not understanding their work or experience. Resolving that misalignment makes the next conversation, about growth areas, more focused and productive.
- Once you understand where the member of your team is, you can work on a growth plan. With that person, agree on a few areas where they want to focus on improvement. Identify concrete projects and actions that will give them an opportunity to build and showcase their skills. For example, for someone who wants to work on communicating analyses at a higher level, find a project where they’ll need to present findings and recommendations to senior leadership, and let them be the analytics lead on the project.
- About 6 months later, you’ll check back in and see how the plan has gone. I like to keep a running document, with descriptions or links to the work that demonstrates various achievements. Hopefully, the competency assessment looks a little bit different as they’ve worked on a growth area, and you can determine a new area of focus. And if the person is nearing the next level across competencies, you can talk about when that person should be nominated or nominate themselves for a promotion.

These structured conversations are very helpful in breaking down growth plans into achievable portions and in aligning the needs of the organization (in the form of a rough team-level roadmap) with the personal desires of your team. They also create a running record of growth that can be used in formal reviews and promotion nominations.

### Managing Upward
Promotion processes vary substantially across organizations, but generally, you as team manager won’t be making the decision completely independently.  You’ll need the support of your manager and some sort of approval committee to get your team members promoted. The career ladder is a great tool to align with those folks and make sure that promotion nominations are well-structured and likely to be approved.

Hopefully, when you created your guiding principles, you brought these people into the process to understand what roles exist for your team, and what the big picture differences are between them. The guiding principles are helpful in framing the answer to two key questions: why does the organization need a higher level role, and why is this person ready for that role?

Before promotion time approaches, make sure you’re communicating with your manager about where your team members stand and when you’d like to nominate them (or when they’ll likely be nominating themselves, if that’s how your org works).


## What to do if you don’t have a ladder?
All of this is great if you lead a team. But if you don’t have a career ladder, and aren’t the one responsible for creating it (yet), here’s one approach to get more clarity around your growth path and promotion potential:
- Understand the promotion process within your company. Ask your manager and/or HR to help you get clarity around when promotions happen, what kind of documentation you’ll need for it, who has to approve it, whether there are promotion benchmarks or limits (e.g. no more than 20% of employees should be promoted per year) and any other details about the process.
- Ask your manager if there is a career ladder. Sometimes there is a document floating around somewhere, but it isn’t used effectively. You can help them leverage what already exists!
- If there is no ladder, borrow someone else’s. Find a ladder as close to your role as possible. Make a copy of it, and change anything that is glaringly not applicable or missing to align with your role. Don’t spend too much time on this, just get it in the ballpark.
- Schedule time with your manager to review the ladder, whether it’s an unused internal document or an external document. Tell them that you would like more structure around your growth priorities, and ask them if the ladder is a reasonable representation of skills you need to reach the next level. It doesn’t have to be perfect or comprehensive, just good enough to give direction for the next few months.
- Use the review process outlined above: you and your manager should both assess where you are on the ladder, and align on any discrepancies. Then choose a few areas to focus on over the next 3-6 months, and work with your manager to find specific projects that will let you flex those skills.
- Go do great work.
- After one or two rounds of this, ask your manager very specifically what still stands between you and your next promotion. This is when a borrowed ladder may not be good enough - they may not write a full ladder for you, but after some clear, structured conversations about your progress your manager should be able to communicate clearly what you still need to do to be considered for promotion.
- Go do more great work. Keep asking specific questions and checking in on the focus projects you identified. Follow up with your manager on the promotion process and expectations.

Career ladders provide structure around career advancement, mitigate bias, and help eliminate glue work. Crafting a well thought out career ladder takes time, but is incredibly valuable as a tool to guide growth conversations that keep your team happy and constantly expanding their skills.
