## Week 1: Introduce the problem

### Give some homework

### Build intuition

## Week 2: Compare averages

### Introduce Normal Dist

### More homework

## Week 3: Formalize a test

### What's a p-value?

### More homework

## Week 4: What assumptions did we make?

### Conversion vs. Normal

### This is 1 test. We could be wrong?

## Conclusion

It's not perfect, and you might not even run AB tests this way (i.e., Bayesian inference, Multi-armed bandits). But it's important to know what the most popular approach is. You'll also learn: hypothesis testing, introduction to Binomial and Normal distribution and thinking in terms of distributions. Having a better appreciation for randomness and precision of language. A more convrete sense of sample size and confidence. Plus hands on opportunity to code in a statistical way, e.g., run
simulations, built-in tests, exposure to scipy in Python.
