If you are lucky, you know what it will take to get your next promotion. Maybe you need to work on communicating your analyses at the C-level instead of primarily to functional managers. Maybe you need to finish a complex project like a predictive churn model. But there is an awful lot of work in every analytics role that just has to be done, even if it doesn’t seem to help you get from where you are to where you want to be.

Tanya Reilly created the term [glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue) to capture “the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful.” Without glue work, projects fall apart - tasks get dropped, teams miscommunicate, and it is just harder to get things done. However, if you spend too much time doing glue work, you risk not spending enough on the “technical” work for which you were hired and which will enable you to get promoted.

Analytics has become much more technical in recent years, and Reilly’s descriptions of glue work resonate in some ways. But analytics is by its nature more collaborative and cross-functional than engineering, and I think that yields some meaningful differences. How should we be thinking about glue work?

##What Does Glue Work Look Like in Analytics?
The concept of glue work applies in just about every role. However, the specifics vary - and defining what it looks like on your team is the first step. The short answer is, what is glue work varies depending on what is in your job description or on your career ladder. It might include any of the following:
- Documentation
- Interviewing
- Training business users on tools or data sources
- Building the [culture of partnership](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/culture_of_partnership/)
- [Communicating well](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/bad_communication/) within the analytics team and across the company
- Unblocking a teammate
- Responding to ad-hoc questions and triaging inbound requests
- Building subject matter expertise
- Creating a pull request template for the team
- Trialing a new collaboration tool and making a recommendation to the team
- Anything that affects how your team works instead of the work itself
Sometimes within analytics teams, it’s work that crosses job descriptions. It can be:
- The analyst who implements automated testing
- The engineer who reaches out directly to a sales rep to understand how the data they are scraping ultimately gets used so they can improve the quality
- The junior team member who remembers what a debacle their onboarding was, and creates a new onboarding plan for the next hire
And sometimes, technical data folks report into a less technical manager, or have to pitch their promotion recommendations to a less technical leader. In that case, technical work can become glue work, including:
- Designing processes and systems that scale well
- Implementing monitoring and alerts for data freshness or quality
- Improving query performance
- Anything that is not immediately visible to end users of a reporting or visualization tool
All of this work is important and valuable. And all of it belongs in an analytics team. However, there is a difference between *valuable* and *valued*. If there’s nothing in your job description or career ladder that addresses this work, when it comes to promo time, it can be hard to get credit for the time you spend on these tasks.  If glue work makes the team function more smoothly and effectively, but it is not valued, then that is a problem.

##Why It Matters
I have managed analytics teams within several small, fast-growing companies. The types of work listed above are critical to ensuring that analysts' work is efficient, relevant, impactful, and scalable. Spending a week on a really interesting analysis that turns out not to be actionable - for example, recommending a change to operations that we can’t implement due to existing contract terms - feels like a waste of time to the analyst and doesn’t make our team look good. That analyst should be rewarded for spending time up front really understanding the situation and the boundaries. Spending extra time writing tests every time you write a transformation job (or spending a week writing lots of tests for existing jobs!) isn’t exciting to most people in the company, but is also really important to our ability to develop quickly and reliably. So, I *want* my team to be rewarded for glue work.

But I especially care because the distribution of glue work is not equitable. Women are more likely to [volunteer](https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions) for non-promotable tasks at work (much like they do at [home](https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/household.htm), but that is another story). [Representation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gB74e9bnlFycOwnfFI2GgCM0uuWnN9Tr/view?usp=sharing) of women in analytics varies across specialties - women and men are close to equally represented among analysts, but less than a quarter of data scientists and engineers are women. Only 24% of analytics leaders are women. Tackling glue work is a real, tangible way we can help to move those numbers and see more equitable gender representation in analytics leadership.

If you don’t have any women on your analytics team, well, think about that the next time you’re hiring. But in male-only groups, the same men tend to [volunteer](https://hbr.org/2018/07/why-women-volunteer-for-tasks-that-dont-lead-to-promotions) time after time for non-promotable tasks. So regardless of the gender makeup of your team, a small number of people on your team are probably doing this work without being rewarded for it.

##The Meta-Story
Arguably, analytics itself is glue within many companies. In most companies, the analytics team is not responsible for a revenue target. The team may not own any OKRs. The impact of analytics is subtler. Good analysts serve as multipliers, enabling the company to identify and focus on areas where changes can have the most impact. We don’t build features, we don’t close deals, but we shape the processes, tools, and cultures that enable companies to be smarter and faster across the board.

Yet, there is often confusion about [what analysts are](https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them) - they just write reports, right? Data science has the opposite problem - folks on the outside think it’s super sexy, but the reality is that it’s sexy occasionally, and boring a lot. Tell someone that the “simple” request they asked for is really multiple days of work because of the transformations necessary to answer their question, and their eyes glaze over.

These disconnects represent a misunderstanding between the company as a whole and the analytics team about what is valuable, and what is valued. Clearly identifying and communicating why different types of analytical work is valued within the team sets the stage to more clearly communicate the value of the analytics team itself to the rest of the company.

##So What Do We Do About It?
The problem of glue work is fixable. If your team is doing work that helps improve the likelihood of success on projects, that work needs to be explicitly valued.

###Managers
If you are in a position to drive systematic change in your organization, you need to:
- Figure out what your team is doing that is not written in their job descriptions. Watch them, and ask them - about themselves and their teammates. Separate the list into work that requires an analyst’s skills and improves the output of the analytics team, and work that doesn’t.
- Work that is truly valuable to your team’s mandate? Write clear career ladders that reward what needs to be done - including glue work. This might include documentation, relationship-building, onboarding new team members, and building subject matter expertise. I have a lot more to say on this - enough to fill another post, coming soon.
- Work that needs to be done, but is not particularly relevant to your team’s mandate? There will always be tasks that are non-promotable but need to get done, like scheduling meetings or planning team off-sites. Either you do that work as team manager, or explicitly assign a fair rotation of these tasks within your team. Don’t wait for volunteers.
- Understand where your team members want to go. Are they trying to get from analyst to senior analyst? Do they want to get from analyst to engineer? Or do they ultimately want to move from analytics into product or marketing? Not everyone wants to climb the same ladder, and sometimes work that is not explicitly promotable in analytics is still helpful in getting that person where they want to be. Just make sure those choices are clear to your team members as you work with them on development plans.
- If there is enough of it, what used to be glue work can become its own role. That can be a rotating role, like a daily [triager](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#triager) who answers questions, acknowledges inbound requests, and begins the process of estimating and prioritizing. In can be a whole new analytics role, like an [analytics engineer](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/) who fills the gaps between analysts and data engineers. Or for coordination, scheduling, and team management, maybe you need a project manager or a team coordinator for whom excelling at these tasks is their core focus and helps them achieve their career goals.

###Non-Managers
Maybe you are not in a position to change the system - yet. So what can you do to make it more likely that you’ll get promoted (and eventually be able to make those changes yourself)?
- Understand where you want to go. If you are aiming for a promotion within analytics, talk to your manager to understand what’s necessary to get there. If you have another goal, find a mentor who can help you create a path. “Promotable” is only meaningful when you know what promotion you’re aiming for.
- Figure out what you are doing that is not on that path. Talk to your manager and/or mentor about those tasks - find out if that glue work will help you reach your goals, or if she truly doesn’t value it. In a perfect world, your manager sees the value in your glue work and adjust the career ladder to reflect it. But . . .
- If they don’t value the work, stop volunteering for it. That sounds extreme, and it can feel like you are dropping the ball. But if it is important, someone else will step up to share the load, or your manager will assign it (hopefully fairly).
- What if someone asks you specifically to do glue work? Tell them you have different priorities, and suggest someone else who can help share the load.
- Bonus points: help others who over-index in glue work realize what they are doing, and ask whether it serves their goals. Sometimes small things highlight inequity better than big, substantive conversations. Are women the ones who always cut and serve the cake at birthday celebrations? Point that out to your women colleagues, and together, you can all stop doing it. Your male colleagues probably don’t even realize it’s happening, but I promise - they know how to cut a cake too. 

Glue work puts the health of the team ahead of individual accomplishments. It is core to the success of individual projects, but also to maximizing the impact of the analytics team overall. Explicitly valuing glue work and not relying on volunteers to do it levels the playing field and improves gender equity.
