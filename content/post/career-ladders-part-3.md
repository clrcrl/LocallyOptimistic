Providing [clarity and structure](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/career-ladders-part-2/) around expectations empowers your team members to decide what skills and competencies to focus on improving. However, writing the career ladder is only the beginning of effectively using it - to get the most value, you have to communicate it to your team about, and use it as a jumping off point for specific, growth-oriented development conversations.

### Roll it Out
Hopefully, your team knows you're creating a career ladder, and was involved in specifying the skills and competencies within it. But once you’ve finalized your ladder, share it again with your team. Explain why it exists and how you’ll use it. Set clear expectations on what levels mean, and how it will be used. Some of the specific questions I try to answer include:
- Does promotion require demonstrating 100% of the competencies laid out for each level, or is there room for folks to specialize and exceed expectations in one area while not meeting the threshold in another?
- Does your company promote people they believe have the ability to achieve at the next level, or must someone have already demonstrated that level of work for 3 or 6 months before they are eligible for promotion?
- Is there a fixed promotion schedule or is it ad-hoc?
- How do you get nominated for a promotion? Is it self-driven or manager-driven? Do you need to create a promo portfolio, or is it less structured than that?
- How does level affect salary?
- How does your team's ladder fits into the overall company approach to leveling and salaries, if there is one?
Answer any other questions that come up, and make sure your team understands that this is a living document which will likely change over time.

### Growth Conversations
Have regular, growth-focused conversations with your team members. The cadence and content may vary, but I’ll outline what has worked for me.
- When someone joins my team, I have a general career conversation with them to understand where they want to go and how their current position can help them get there. Occasionally I learn, “I don’t actually want to be a Senior Analyst, I want to become a Product Manager.” If so, I do what I can to help them work on developing skills and getting involved with projects that will help them make that transition.
- For folks who do want a promotion on my team, we check in on the career ladder roughly twice a year. The team member and I go through the ladder separately to benchmark where we believe they are in regards to each competency. Doing this assessment independently and then comparing helps highlight areas of misalignment, which may be due to lack of clarity in the job ladder, a lack of self-awareness from your team member, or you not understanding their work or experience. Resolving that misalignment makes the next conversation, about growth areas, more focused and productive.
- Armed with those benchmarks, we create a growth plan together by agreeing on a few areas where they haven't yet been able to demonstrate the skills or proficiencies for the next level, and they want to focus on improvement. Then we identify concrete projects and actions that will give them an opportunity to build and showcase their skills over the next several months. If they have any ongoing responsibilities or projects that don't align with these growth areas, determine what will happen to those projects - can they be handed to someone who will get more out of them? Can you give them a bigger role on those projects, so that there is still growth opportunity? It takes concerted effort to make space for growth while ensuring all of the team's commitments are met.
- Keep checking in on those priorities. Keep them in your 1:1 agenda or set monthly reminders to make sure your team member is able to make progress where they want to. Adjust workloads or expectations as necessary. Help your team member solicit feedback from others regularly as well - do the key stakeholders for their work have any interim feedback that will help them improve?
- About 6 months later, you’ll check back in and see how the plan has gone. Keep a running document, with descriptions or links to work demonstrating various competencies. Hopefully, the assessment looks a little bit different as they’ve worked on a growth area, and you can determine a new area of focus. And if the person is nearing the next level across competencies, you can talk about when that person should be nominated or nominate themselves for a promotion.

These structured conversations help to break down growth plans into achievable scope and align the needs of the organization (in the form of upcoming projects) with the personal desires of your team. They also create a running record of growth that can be used in formal performance reviews and promotion nominations.

### Managing Upward
Before promotion time approaches, make sure you’re communicating with your manager about where your team members stand and when you’d like to nominate them (or when they’ll likely be nominating themselves, if that’s how your org works). Understand the promotion process, likelihood of promo approval, any limits on the number of promotions (e.g. no more than 20% of employees should be promoted per year), and how you can help your team be ready. Use that information to set expectations appropriately for your team, and find avenues for growth even if it they aren't likely to get a promotion this cycle.

### Promotion Announcements
Announcing promotions are one of the most fun parts of managing a team. First, telling the person who is being promoted, then telling the entire company - it's chock full of warm fuzzies. But promotion announcements are also a powerful opportunity to reinforce the principles that underpin your career ladder to both the person being promoted and everyone else. What work did they do that showed they had made that step function from one role to another? If there are undersung skills they demonstrated - unblocking and mentoring teammates, or focusing on automation to empower people to focus on higher-value work - now is the to make sure everyone knows that these things really do help you reach the next level.

### Hiring
Talk to candidates about the career ladder, and how you use it - the fact that the company takes a clear and structured approach to coaching and development is a significant selling point. Within the hiring process, use your ladder to align candidates with levels. Create interview questions designed to tease out where someone is in relation to your levels, and hire them accordingly. Make it clear when you give them an offer what level they are being offered, and talk about level before they accept. The level you're offering may not align with their current level, or where they think they belong, so make sure they understand why that level, and what it will take to get to the next level.

## What If You Don't Have a Career Ladder?
All of this is great if you lead a team. But if you don’t have a career ladder, and aren’t the one responsible for creating it (yet), here’s one approach to get more clarity around your growth path and promotion potential:
- Understand the promotion process within your company. Ask your manager and/or HR to help you get clarity around when promotions happen, what kind of documentation you’ll need for it, who has to approve it, whether there are promotion benchmarks or limits (e.g. no more than 20% of employees should be promoted per year), and any other details about the process.
- Ask your manager if there is a career ladder. Sometimes there is a document floating around somewhere, but it isn’t used effectively. You can help them leverage what already exists!
- If there is no ladder, borrow someone else’s. Find a ladder as close to your role as possible. Make a copy of it, and change anything that is glaringly not applicable or missing to align with your role. Don’t spend too much time on this, just get it in the ballpark so you can start a real conversation.
- Schedule time with your manager to review the ladder, whether it’s an unused internal document or an external document. Tell them that you would like more structure around your growth priorities, and ask them if the ladder is a reasonable representation of skills you need to reach the next level. Adjust as needed, but at this point it doesn’t have to be perfect or comprehensive - just good enough to give direction for the next few months.
- Use the review process outlined above: you and your manager should both assess where you are on the ladder, and align on any discrepancies. Then choose a few areas to focus on over the next 3-6 months, and work with your manager to find specific projects that will let you flex those skills.
- Go do great work.
- After one or two rounds of this, ask your manager very specifically what still stands between you and your next promotion. This is when a borrowed ladder may not be good enough - they may not write a full ladder for you, but after some clear, structured conversations about your progress, your manager should be able to communicate clearly what you still need to do to be considered for promotion.
- Go do more great work. Keep asking specific questions and checking in on the focus projects you identified. Follow up with your manager on the promotion process and expectations.

## Conclusion
The process of creating a ladder and using it well sparks important conversations about priorities and growth. As analytics teams continue to evolve, a solid framework for growth can be relatively easily adapted to emerging role and specialties, while still providing structure around career advancement, mitigating bias, and helping eliminate glue work.
