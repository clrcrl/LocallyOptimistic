Imagine you hit a roadblock while trying to tackle a complex piece of analysis, using a python function or designing your first data organization. What do you do? Of course you first search the internet, but what do you do when you're really stuck? I like to phone a friend. 

In this post I explore my favorite learning style - learning from others - and the steps to building your own analytics brain trust. I have used this approach for many challenges (including building an Analytics team from the ground up) and I believe it can be applied to most challenges.

Before I dive in, it is worth noting that you can only be successful at this if you truly enjoy talking to and learning from other people.


## Origin story

In a past life I worked as a management consultant, often undertaking strategy projects in obscure industries (fun fact: if you can think of it, a company somewhere in the world does it). Due to the niche nature of these industries, internet resources were typically unhelpful or unavailable. As a result, we often spoke to experts in the field - scientists, business leaders, researchers and end-users.

What impressed me the most by the industry experts was their ability to distill the most important aspects of an idea and convey them in a way anyone could understand. Of course it was hit or miss (some experts were just plain bad) and you had to do enough preparatory research to ask good questions (and to keep the calls short and focused since you were often paying by the expert). However, when you did get a great expert on the phone - an hour with them could save a week of research. 


## Building your (analytics) brain trust

Fast forward to starting my first Analytics team at a small startup. It would be an understatement to say I had no idea what I was doing. However, I had one thing going for me, I knew how to build up knowledge fast - by phoning a friend. I just had one problem - I didn't have any friends in analytics. So how do you build your analytics brain trust?

As a quick side note - this is how I met [Ilan, Michael and Sam]({{< relref "about.md" >}})) and many of my other NYC data friends.


### Step 1: Assume people will be receptive

Everyone started where you are (i.e. with no network and no knowledge) and many of them are open to having conversations either out of genuine friendliness or a desire to "pay it forward." When you first start it may be scary to reach out to people with whom you have a tenuous connection at best, but remember people are generally nice. You will be surprised who will respond (for example, [a twelve year old Steve Jobs successfully reached out to Bill Hewlett, the CEO of HP](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-we-can-learn-from-the-gutsy-way-steve-jobs-landed-a-job-at-hp-2015-7)). After all, what is the worst that can happen - they say no or don't respond at all?


### Step 2: Set a goal and do your research

Make sure you have a defined knowledge goal before you begin reaching out to people and be as specific as possible. There is nothing worse than giving your time to talk to someone when they don't know what they want. 

In my case my goal was: 

>I am building an Analytics team, so I am looking to speak with others who have done it before. Specifically I would like to learn about specialist vs generalist models, titles and how the Analytics team interfaces with the rest of the organization.

I also recommend doing specific research on the people you contact to understand what relevant experience or knowledge they may have. This will allow you to craft your message and, in the event of a conversation, your questions.


### Step 3: Reach out to your warmest connections (and be accommodating)

Message your warmest connections who may have relevant knowledge or may know others who have relevant knowledge. If you don't have any warm connections, contact people who you have something in common with (e.g., university, home town, industry). Linkedin is a great place to meet new contacts, but industry-specific or topic-specific messaging boards / Slack communities are even better.

Craft your message so that it is specific, friendly and most importantly accommodating. Make meeting you sound like a very light lift. Here is a message I sent many years ago:

>Hi XXX, I am building out an Analytics team and would love to chat with you to learn about how you've gone about building your team at YYY company. I can imagine you have similar challenges (e.g., interfacing with stakeholders and deciding on the generalist vs specialist model). Happy to work around your schedule and come to you. Let me know when works best.


### Step 4: Ask good questions and make a genuine connection

People can quickly tell if you are being disingenuous and only want a job or an introduction. I advise going into the conversation with the goal of learning and potentially forming a professional or personal relationship - a job or an introduction is icing on the cake. I met many of my closest friends in the NYC scene through conversations just like this.

During the conversation, make sure you have a list of topics you want to cover, but allow the conversation to flow naturally. You don't want your coffee chat to feel like an interrogation. Also, if you force the conversation down a specific path you may miss a relevant topic that your coffee mate is especially knowledgeable or passionate about.


### Step 5: Ask for recommended contacts (and repeat)

While your first wave of conversations may not be perfectly relevant to the topics you area looking to learn about, your coffee mates may know other, more relevant people to chat with. After a genuine, friendly conversation it is perfectly acceptable to ask your coffee mate if she has anyone you would recommend. You may even find that during a great conversation your coffee mate might even start mentioning people to talk to without you even having to ask.

You will not hit it off with everyone you meet and that is fine - just make sure you are polite and respectful. However, if you continue to work at it you will continue to develop your own analytics expert network and hopefully meet a few friends.


## So when do you stop? Never.

I'm in the field of Analytics, because I love it and like any topic I love, I am happy to talk (and write) about it for hours. Whether it is a conversation over lunch or a panel at a conference, I continue to learn from the diverse opinions of my friends and colleagues. While we may not always agree (you should hear Michael and me discuss [reporting]({{< relref "datareporting-is-a-gateway-drug.md" >}})), I always learn.

Your analytics brain trust is especially helpful to stay on top of the latest developments in an evolving field like Analytics. It is impossible to stay on top of every new technology and trend so it have a diverse group of friends with a wide range of interests.


## Giving back and paying forward

They system only works if you give back. People quickly notice if you are always asking questions but never answering them, asking for introductions but never offering them or asking people to chat but never accepting invitations. Try to keep track of your "karmic balance" and make sure you are contributing as much as you are benefiting. Of course there are always times when you are underwater and can't contribute, just be very honest with people when they reach out.

One challenge, of course, is how to give back if you don't know anything. An easy way to start is to share interesting articles and blog posts you find (it is very difficult to stay on top of everything that is written in the space, so I love when people send me interesting articles). Once you begin to gain more experience you will probably find a couple topics you are passionate about and could talk about for hours (e.g., [agile analytics]({{< relref "agile-analytics-p1.md" >}}), [the prioritization meeting]({{< relref "prioritization_meeting.md" >}}), [data warehouse SLAs]({{< relref "data-warehouse-sla-p1.md" >}}), [communication]({{< relref "bad_communication.md" >}}) and [web analytics]({{< relref "web-analytics-process.md" >}})). At its best, building your analytics brain trust looks a lot like two friends or colleagues discussing topics they are passionate about, because that is exactly what it is.
