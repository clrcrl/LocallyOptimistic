Have we left the Oil Age and entered the Data Age? Some would argue so. Undoubtedly, there is more data available than ever, and we are just uncovering the tip on what's possible with it. Most companies have embraced this and are employing often multiple people in an Analytics function.

But what's the best way to set your org structure up for success?

The way different Analysts' reporting lines are set up falls into four distinct archetypes.

## Scattered

In a scattered Analytics function, different departments or units of the organization have employees that have various degrees of Analytical skills. Often, those are not formally part of their job title, but just happen to make them (or their teams) successful at their job. This might be the sales manager who happens to be able to run sophisticated and accurate forecast models, or the product manager who employs statistical analyses to spot anomaly trends in the performance of his products.

While this set up can work well for a long time, you usually see it in companies who haven't realized as a whole the vlaue that insights from data bring. The lack of alignment and knowledge exchange between the individuals performing Analytics limits the value they can provide.

## Embedded

The next step are embedded Analytics functions in which there are designated Analysts in each team, that is people whose job title actually is something like *Analyst*, grouped together in each business unit. There might be an Analytics team for the Sales organization, one for Marketing, and another one for IT Operations.

This is a big advancement. Analysts can exchange ideas with each other, align on methodologies and become develop common standards for the unit they're working in.

While this is a common setup, it usually is a symptom of a siloed company culture in general where different business function work independently from each other and any alignment between functions can only be cascaded down from the top management levels.

It also comes with the downside that ressources cannot easily be shifted between units.

## Centralized

Let's break up those silos then! Merge all Analysts into a central group with a standardized intake process. The Analytics team then allocates ressources to each "ticket" and fulfills the requests.

While this can be the most ressource-effective approach, it's often *politically* difficult because it means that different business units compete about the same Analysts. It requires either a strong Analytics lead with a clear and trusted voice in setting priorities, or a system of cost-allocation whereby Analyst's time is allocated to different projects. Companies who have project-based time tracking anyway (agencies, law offices) are a natural fit for this.

## Central-Embedded

So what should we do then? Those are all the options, no?

This brings us to option number four. Basically a mix of the two previous organizational setups, the *central-embedded* org structure consists of an Analytics department which consists of all Analysts in the company. Nevertheless, those Analysts are also associated with different business units, meaning that every Analyst has a direct reporting line to his Analytics manager and a dotted line to the manager of the team they're supporting.

This allows the Analytics function to work as one team and set common standards and guidelines. It also provides a common platform to resolve difficulties. Resources can be allocated more flexibly than in a pure embedded function; not only depending on the current needs of the company, but also based on each Analyst's career objectives.

At the same time, each Analyst can become a domain expert and deeply connected ressource for the team they're supporting. They bridge the communication within the team with cross-functional alignment throughout the Analytics team.

There can be prioritization struggles between the different group managers and the Analytics manager. Not only a challenge, this can also be a great opportunity because it requires different department heads to be in close exchange and alignment with each other.
